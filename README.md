# Extras for RetroPie themes

> This is my first shell script ever, so there are surely code errors. [Contributing](#contributing) is most welcomed.

This script let's you install some extras for RetroPie themes. These extras are:

* [x] Icons
* [x] Splashscreens
* [x] Launching images

![Install Pixel](example-images/example-01.jpg "Install Pixel")
![Update or Uninstall Pixel](example-images/example-02.jpg "Update or Uninstall Pixel")
![Extras](example-images/example-03.jpg "Extras")
![Install Pixel icons](example-images/example-04.jpg "Install Pixel icons")
![Install Pixel splashscreen](example-images/example-05.jpg "Install Pixel splashscreen")
![Choose splashscreen](example-images/example-06.jpg "Choose splashscreen")
![Install Pixel launching images](example-images/example-07.jpg "Install Pixel launching images")

## Installation

```
cd /home/pi/
git clone https://github.com/hiulit/es-theme-extras.git
cd es-theme-extras/
sudo chmod +x es-theme-extras.sh
sudo ./es-theme-extras.sh
```

## The big issue

At this moment, [Pixel](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-theme-pixel) is the only theme that works with this script because it's the only one (that I know of) that has [icons](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-theme-pixel/tree/master/retropie/icons), splashscreens ([16:9](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-theme-pixel/blob/master/splash16-9.png) and [4:3](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-theme-pixel/blob/master/splash4-3.png)) and [launching images](https://github.com/ehettervik/es-runcommand-splash).

Pixel theme has both icons and splashscreens in the same repository and launching images has its own repository.

This script is created under these premises:

* Icons and splashscreens must be in the same repository `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME`.
* Icons must be in path `/retropie/icons`.
* Splashscreens must be in the root path and named `splash16-9.png` and/or `splash4-3.png`.
* Launching images must be in another repository `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-runcommand-splash`.

I think that could be **standarized** so that every theme could take advantage of this script.

## Proposal for standarization

I propose two versions:

* [Self-contained](#self-contained-same-repository-version) (all extras in the same repository).
* [Diferent repositories](#diferent-repositories-version) for each extra (icons, splashscreens and launching images).

When the decision is made, I'll make the necessary changes according to the version agreed upon.

### Self-contained (same repository) version

* **Theme URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME`
* **Icons URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME/retropie/icons`
* **Splashscreens URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME/retropie/splashscreens`
* **Launching images URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME/retropie/launching-images`

### Diferent repositories version

* **Theme URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME`
* **Icons URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME-icons`
* **Splashscreens URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME-splashscreens`
* **Launching images URL**: `https://github.com/USERNAME/es-theme-THEME-launching-images`

Where **USERNAME** is GitHub's username and **THEME** is the theme's name.

## Filetype, naming convention and formatting

In both cases the filetype, naming convention and formatting must be the same, as follows:

* [Icons](#icons)
* [Splashscreens](#splashscreens)
* [Launching images](#launching-images)
